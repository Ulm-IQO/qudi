**Cwave scanner:** @ Vlad

Wavelength logging:
- [] Log of the previous wavelengths
- [] Histogram of counts vs wavlength:

    *Easily doable: need to use **counterlogic._data_to_save** and **cwavelogic._wavelength_data***
- [] Top axis in nm dynamic

a. External scanner:
- [x] Proper scan ranging
- [] "Stop" scan is not functioning (move to the thread the returning of the scanner)
- [x] Plotting + wavelegth display while scan
- [] Determine area without the mode-hops

b. Internal scanner:
- [] Scan map based on the counter+wavelength data
- [] Determine area w/o the mode-hops (3 V) -> approx 1 GHz?
- [] Smoother scan line transition

c. Opo scanner
- [] Test out 

**Correlation**
- [] Background correction

**Lucid control:** @ Oliver

a. Power control of the AOM

**Counter**
- [x] integrate time tagger hardware file (change mycounter to tagger)
- [x] combine channels
