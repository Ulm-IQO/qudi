    """ Hardware class to control the PulseBlasterESR-PRO card from SpinCore.

    This file is compatible with the PCI version SP18A of the PulseBlasterESR.
    The wrapped commands based on the 'spinapi.h' and the 'pulseblaster.h'
    header file and can be looked up in the SpinAPI Documentation
    (Version 2013-09-25) on the website:

    http://www.spincore.com/support/spinapi/reference/production/2013-09-25/index.html

    The recommended version for the manual is the PDF file from SpinCore:
        http://www.spincore.com/CD/PulseBlasterESR/SP4/PBESR-Pro_Manual.pdf

    Another manual describes the functions a bit better:
        http://spincore.com/CD/PulseBlasterESR/SP1/PBESR_Manual.pdf

    The SpinCore programming library (spinapi.dll, spinapi64.dll, libspinapi.so 
    or libspinapi64.so) is written in C and its data types correspond to 
    standard C/C++ data types as follows:

            char                    8 bit, byte (or characters in ASCII)
            short int               16 bit signed integer
            unsigned short int      16 bit unsigned integer
            int                     32 bit signed integer
            long int                32 bit signed integer
            unsigned int            32 bit unsigned integer
            unsigned long int       32 bit unsigned integer
            float                   32 bit floating point number
            double                  64 bit floating point number

    Example config for copy-paste:

        pulseblaster:
            module.Class: 'spincore.pulse_blaster_esrpro.PulseBlasterESRPRO'
            clock_frequency: 500e6 # in Hz
            min_instr_len: 5    # number of clock cycles for minimal instruction
            debug_mode: False   # optional, to set the debug mode on or off.
            use_smart_pulse_creation: False # optinal, default is false, try to
                                            # optimize the memory used on the device.
            #library_file: 'spinapi64.dll'  # optional, name of the library file
                                            # or  whole path to the file

    Remark to the config values:
        library_file: if the library does not lay in the default directory of
                      your OS (for windows it is 'C:/Windows/System32'), then
                      you need to specify the path.
        clock_frequency: the Spincore board contains a oscillator crystal, which
                         is attached to it and whose value cannot be determined
                         by the hardware. This number should be specified on the
                         board. The PulseBlasterESR-PRO can have the values
                         [300e6, 400e6, 500e6]. Select the correct one!
        min_instr_len:  number of clock cycles for minimal instruction, default
                        is 5. Normally it is 5 but for some boards it is 6 or
                        for old boards it might be even 7. This corresponds to
                        a minimal instruction length of
                            (1/clock_frequency)*min_instr_len
        channel_delays: Specify the delay of some channels to correct it automatically
                         by this module. For example :
                          channel_delays:
                                '0': 200-9
                                '2': 500-9
                         tell the card the line 0 and 2 have a delay of 200 ns and 500 ns respectively
                         so that the pulse are emitted sooner relatively to other channels.
                         The first line is 0 and the last is 20.

        """Retrieve the hardware constrains from the Pulsing device.

        @return constraints object: object with pulser constraints as
                                    attributes.

        Provides all the constraints (e.g. sample_rate, amplitude,
        total_length_bins, channel_config, ...) related to the pulse generator
        hardware to the caller.

            SEE PulserConstraints CLASS IN pulser_interface.py FOR AVAILABLE
            CONSTRAINTS!!!

        If you are not sure about the meaning, look in other hardware files to
        get an impression. If still additional constraints are needed, then they
        have to be added to the PulserConstraints class.

        Each scalar parameter is an ScalarConstraints object defined in
        core.util.interfaces. Essentially it contains min/max values as well as
        min_step_size, default_value and unit of the parameter.

        PulserConstraints.activation_config differs, since it contain the
        channel configuration/activation information of the form:

            {<descriptor_str>: <channel_set>,
             <descriptor_str>: <channel_set>,
             ...}

        If the constraints cannot be set in the pulsing hardware (e.g. because
        it might have no sequence mode) just leave it out so that the default is
        used (only zeros).
