        The major difference to analog signals is that digital signals are
        either ON or OFF, whereas analog channels have a varying amplitude
        range. In contrast to analog output levels, digital output levels are
        defined by a voltage, which corresponds to the ON status and a voltage
        which corresponds to the OFF status (both denoted in (absolute) voltage)

        In general there is no bijective correspondence between
        (amplitude, offset) and (value high, value low)!
