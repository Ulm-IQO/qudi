class NICard(Base, SlowCounterInterface, ConfocalScannerInterface, ODMRCounterInterface):
    """ stable: Kay Jahnke, Alexander Stark

    A National Instruments device that can count and control microvave generators.

    Basic procedure how the NI card is configurated:
      * At first you have to define a channel, where the APD clicks will be
        received. That can be any PFI input, which is specified to record TTL
        pulses.
      * Then two counter channels have to be configured.
      * One counter channel serves as a timing device, i.e. basically a clock
        which runs at a certain given frequency.
      * The second counter channel will be used as a gated counting device,
        which will, dependent on the clock, count within the clock interval. The faster
        the clock channel is configured, the smaller is the gated counting
        interval and the less counts per clock periode you will count.

    Therefore the whole issue is to establish a time based gated-counting
    channel.

    Explanation of the termology, which is used in the NI Card and useful to
    know in connection with our implementation:

    Hardware-Timed Counter Tasks:
        Use hardware-timed counter input operations to drive a control loop. A
        really good explanation can be found in:

        http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370466V-01/mxcncpts/controlappcase4/

    Terminals:
        A terminal is a named location where a signal is either generated
        (output or produced) or acquired (input or consumed). A terminal that
        can output only one signal is often named after that signal. A terminal
        with an input that can be used only for one signal is often named after
        the clock or trigger that the signal is used for. Terminals that are
        used for many signals have generic names such as RTSI, PXITrig, or PFI.

        http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370466W-01/mxcncpts/terminal/
        http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370466V-01/mxcncpts/termnames/

    Ctr0Out, Ctr1Out, Ctr2Out, Ctr3Out:
        Terminals at the I/O connector where the output of counter 0,
        counter 1, counter 2, or counter 3 can be emitted. You also can use
        Ctr0Out as a terminal for driving an external signal onto the RTSI bus.

    Ctr0Gate, Ctr1Gate, Ctr2Gate, Ctr3Gate:
        Terminals within a device whose purpose depends on the application.
        Refer to Counter Parts in NI-DAQmx for more information on how the gate
        terminal is used in various applications.

    Ctr0Source, Ctr1Source, Ctr2Source, Ctr3Source:
        Terminals within a device whose purpose depends on the application.
        Refer to Counter Parts in NI-DAQmx for more information on how the
        source terminal is used in various applications.

    Ctr0InternalOutput, Ctr1InternalOutput, Ctr2InternalOutput,
    Ctr3InternalOutput:
        Terminals within a device where you can choose the pulsed or toggled
        output of the counters. Refer to Counter Parts in NI-DAQmx (or MAX)
        for more information on internal output terminals.

    Task State Model:
        NI-DAQmx uses a task state model to improve ease of use and speed up
        driver performance. Have a look at

        http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370466V-01/mxcncpts/taskstatemodel/

        Small explanation: The task state model consists of five states
            1. Unverified,
            2. Verified,
            3. Reserved,
            4. Committed,
            5. Running.
        You call the Start Task function/VI, Stop Task function/VI, and
        Control Task function/VI to transition the task from one state to
        another. The task state model is very flexible. You can choose to
        interact with as little or as much of the task state model as your
        application requires.

    Device limitations:
        Keep in mind that ONLY the X-series of the NI cards is capable of doing
        a Counter Output Pulse Frequency Train with finite numbers of samples
        by using ONE internal device channel clock (that is the function
        DAQmxCreateCOPulseChanFreq or CO Pulse Freq in Labview)! All other card
        series have to use two counters to generate that!
        Check out the description of NI which tells you 'How Many Counters Does
        Each Type of Counter Input or Output Task Take':

        http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/9D1780F448D10F4686257590007B15A8

        This code was tested with NI 6323 and NI 6229, where the first one is
        an X-series device and the latter one is a Low-Cost M Series device.
        With the NI 6229 it is not possible at all to perform the scanning
        task unless you have two of that cards. The limitation came from a lack
        of internal counters.
        The NI 6323 was taken as a basis for this hardware module and thus all
        the function are working on that card.
