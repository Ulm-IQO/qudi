        Provides all the constraints (e.g. sample_rate, amplitude, total_length_bins,
        channel_config, ...) related to the pulse generator hardware to the caller.

            SEE PulserConstraints CLASS IN pulser_interface.py FOR AVAILABLE CONSTRAINTS!!!

        If you are not sure about the meaning, look in other hardware files to get an impression.
        If still additional constraints are needed, then they have to be added to the
        PulserConstraints class.

        Each scalar parameter is an ScalarConstraints object defined in cor.util.interfaces.
        Essentially it contains min/max values as well as min step size, default value and unit of
        the parameter.

        PulserConstraints.activation_config differs, since it contain the channel
        configuration/activation information of the form:
            {<descriptor_str>: <channel_list>,
             <descriptor_str>: <channel_list>,
             ...}
