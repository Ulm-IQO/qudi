:: Basically this just creates a VBS Script on the fly and invokes the batch
:: script using it.  It checks to see if the current window is running as
:: administrator by attempting to create a folder that requires administrative
:: access.  If the directory can not be created, then it invokes the UAC
:: dialog, then closes the non-admin window.  The script can also be executed
:: from an already open administrative CLI.

:: Idea is taken from:
