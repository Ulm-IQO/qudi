"""
An interfuse file is indented to fuse/combine a logic with a hardware, which
was not indented to be used with the logic. The interfuse file extend the
ability of a hardware file by converting the logic calls (from a different
interface) to the interface commands, which suits the hardware.
In order to be addressed by the (magnet) logic it should inherit the (magnet)
interface, and given the fact that it will convert a magnet logic call to a
motor hardware call, that 'interfuse' file has to stick to the interfaces
methods of the motor interface.

Reimplement each call from the magnet interface and use only the motor interface
command to talk to a xyz motor hardware and a rotational motor hardware.
