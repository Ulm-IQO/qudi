Licensing                {#license}
============

As a lot of functions in QuDi are derived (copied and adapted) from pi3diamond
and there is definitive evidence that pi3diamond is partially or completely
licensed under the _GNU Public License Version 3_, it is the easiest solution
for each author to also license their contribution to the software as GPLv3.

Please add this header to every Python file that you create manually.
