Licensing                {#license}
============

Some of the base structure and library usage decisions of QuDi were ws taken from
the ACQ4 project (http://acq4.org and [1]), which is distributed under the 
[MIT Licens](@ref mitlicense).

Some functions in QuDi are adapted from or inspired by pi3diamond from the 
3. Institut für Physik of Stuttgart University and there is definitive evidence
that pi3diamond is mostly licensed under the _[GNU Public License Version 3](@ref gpl)_,
it is the easiest solution for each author to also license their contribution
to this software as [GPLv3](@ref gpl).

Please add this header to every Python file that you create manually.
