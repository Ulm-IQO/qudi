    """ Interface class to define the abstract controls and communication with all pulsing devices.

    A pulsing device is a device that will generate outputs, generally voltages, to control an experiment in a timely
    resolved way. This is by example useful to control a modulator device with a short risetime on a very short
    timescale.

    An example in the lab is to use a pulser to send laser pulses of a given duration separated by another precisely
     controlled duration.

    This interface is used to program or or multiple sequences or waveform in the internal memory of a pulser hardware,
    then load one and play it.
    - It handles digital and analog outputs of any number.
    - It handles both -
        Waveform, where states (outputs) and durations of a waveform is programmed and played
        Sequence, where states (outputs) and durations and instructions are used, where one can program at the hardware
            level jumps and loops to create complex sequence with a limited device memory.

        Retrieve the hardware constrains from the Pulsing device.

        @return constraints object: object with pulser constraints as attributes.

        Provides all the constraints (e.g. sample_rate, amplitude, total_length_bins,
        channel_config, ...) related to the pulse generator hardware to the caller.

            SEE PulserConstraints CLASS IN pulser_interface.py FOR AVAILABLE CONSTRAINTS!!!

        If you are not sure about the meaning, look in other hardware files to get an impression.
        If still additional constraints are needed, then they have to be added to the
        PulserConstraints class.

        Each scalar parameter is an ScalarConstraints object defined in core.util.interfaces.
        Essentially it contains min/max values as well as min step size, default value and unit of
        the parameter.

        PulserConstraints.activation_config differs, since it contain the channel
        configuration/activation information of the form:
            {<descriptor_str>: <channel_set>,
             <descriptor_str>: <channel_set>,
             ...}

        If the constraints cannot be set in the pulsing hardware (e.g. because it might have no
        sequence mode) just leave it out so that the default is used (only zeros).
