    Extension IVI methods for function generators that can produce sequences of arbitrary waveforms

    The IviFgenArbSeq extension group supports function generators capable of producing sequences of arbitrary
    waveforms. In order to support this extension, a driver must first support the IviFgenArbWfm extension group.
    This extension uses the IviFgenArbWfm extension group's attributes of sample rate, gain, and offset to configure
    a sequence. The IviFgenArbSeq extension group includes functions for creating, configuring, and generating
    sequences, and for returning information about arbitrary sequence creation.

    This extension affects instrument behavior when the Output Mode attribute is set to Output Sequence.

    This specification defines an arbitrary sequence as a list of arbitrary waveforms to produce. Each waveform in the
    sequence is repeated a discrete number of times before producing the next waveform. When generating an arbitrary
    sequence, the waveform properties of Gain, Offset and Sample Rate defined in Section 6.1, IviFgenArbWfm Overview
    apply to all waveforms in the sequence.

    If the function generator supports an internal modulating waveform source, the user can specify the waveform,
    frequency, and modulation depth. Amplitude modulation is accomplished by varying the amplitude of a carrier
    waveform according to the amplitude of a modulating waveform. The general equation for applying amplitude modulation
    to a waveform is,
    AM(t) = [M(t) + 1] x C(t),
    where C(t) is the carrier waveform, M(t) is the modulating waveform, and AM(t) is the modulated signal.

    This specification provides modulating waveform property definitions that must be followed when developing specific

    modulation. You configure the carrier waveform with the IviFgenStdFunc, IviFgenArbWfm, or IviFgenArbSeq capability
    groups.

    The modulating waveform is defined by the following properties:

    Waveform – The overall “shape” of one period of the modulating waveform. This specification defines five modulating
               waveforms: Sine, Square, Triangle, Ramp Up, and Ramp Down.
    Frequency – The number of modulating waveform cycles generated in one second.
    Modulation Depth – The extent to which the modulating waveform affects the amplitude of the carrier waveform. This

    At the maximum peak of the modulating waveform, the amplitude of the output signal is equal to
    (100.0 + Modulation Depth) percent of the carrier signal amplitude. At the minimum peak of the modulating waveform,
    the amplitude of the output signal is equal to (100.0 – Modulation Depth) percent of the carrier signal amplitude.
    At a modulation depth of 0 percent, the modulating waveform has no affect on the carrier waveform. At a modulation
    depth of 100 percent, the amplitude of the output signal varies between 0.0V and twice the amplitude of the carrier
    signal.
