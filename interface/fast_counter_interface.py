    def get_constraints(self):
        """ Retrieve the hardware constrains from the Fast counting device.

        @return dict: dict with keys being the constraint names as string and
                      items are the definition for the constaints.

         The keys of the returned dictionary are the str name for the constraints
        (which are set in this method).

                    NO OTHER KEYS SHOULD BE INVENTED!

        If you are not sure about the meaning, look in other hardware files to
        get an impression. If still additional constraints are needed, then they
        have to be added to all files containing this interface.

        The items of the keys are again dictionaries which have the generic
        dictionary form:
            {'min': <value>,
             'max': <value>,
             'step': <value>,
             'unit': '<value>'}

        Only the key 'hardware_binwidth_list' differs, since they
        contain the list of possible binwidths.

        If the constraints cannot be set in the fast counting hardware then
        write just zero to each key of the generic dicts.
        Note that there is a difference between float input (0.0) and
        integer input (0), because some logic modules might rely on that
        distinction.

        ALL THE PRESENT KEYS OF THE CONSTRAINTS DICT MUST BE ASSIGNED!

        # Example for configuration with default values:

        constraints = dict()

        # the unit of those entries are seconds per bin. In order to get the
        # current binwidth in seonds use the get_binwidth method.
