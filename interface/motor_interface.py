                      constraints will be passed via the logic to the GUI so
                      that proper display elements with boundary conditions
                      could be made.

        Provides all the constraints for each axis of a motorized stage
        (like total travel distance, velocity, ...)
        Each axis has its own dictionary, where the label is used as the
        identifier throughout the whole module. The dictionaries for each axis
        are again grouped together in a constraints dictionary in the form

            {'<label_axis0>': axis0 }

        where axis0 is again a dict with the possible values defined below. The
        possible keys in the constraint are defined here in the interface file.
        If the hardware does not support the values for the constraints, then
        insert just None. If you are not sure about the meaning, look in other
        hardware files to get an impression.

        Example of how a return dict with constraints might look like:
