# qudi
Qudi is a suite of tools for operating multi-instrument and multi-computer laboratory experiments.
Originally built around a confocal fluorescence microscope experiments, it has grown to be a generally applicaple framework for controlling experiments.

## Features
  * A modular and extendable architecture
  * Access to devices on other computers over network
  * XYZ piezo or galvo control for confocal fluorescence microscopy via National Instruments X-Series devices
  * Position optimization for fluorescent spots
  * Tracking of fluorescent spots
  * Tektronix AWG 5000 7000 and 70000 support for pulsed microwave experiments
  * Anritsu MG37022A, MG3696B and MG3961C, R&S SMIQ and SMR support for ODMR measurements
  * Getting spectra from the WinSpec32 spectroscopy software
  * Thorlabs APT motor control
  * Magnetic field alignment for NV- in diamond via fluorescence, ODMR and nuclear spin
  * etc.

## Citation
If you are publishing scientific results, mentioning Qudi in your methods decscription is the least you can do as good scientific practice.
You should cite our paper [Qudi: A modular python suite for experiment control and data processing](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2017.02.001) for this purpose.

## Collaboration
For development-related questions and discussion, please use the [qudi-dev mailing list](http://www.freelists.org/list/qudi-dev).

If you just want updates about releases and breaking changes to Qudi without discussion or issue reports,
subscribe to the [qudi-announce mailing list](http://www.freelists.org/list/qudi-announce).

Feel free to add issues and pull requests for improvements on github at https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi .

The code in pull requests should be clean, PEP8-compliant and commented, as with every academic institution in Germany,
our resources in the area of software development are quite limited.

Do not expect help, debugging efforts or other support.
