# qudi
QuDi is a suite of tools for operating laboratory experiments built around a confocal fluorescence microscope.
It was designed initially to perform *Qu*antum optics on *Di*amond color centres, but has utility in a far broader range of experimental contexts.

## Citation
If you are publishing scientific results, mentioning Qudi in your methods decscription is the least you can do as good scientific practice.
We are preparing a paper about the software and DOIs for releases, which will make this process easier and more reliable.

## Documentation
User and code documentation about Qudi is located at http://qosvn2.physik.uni-ulm.de/qudi-docs

## Collaboration
Feel free to add issues and pull requests for improvements.
However, as with every academic institution in Germany, our resources in the area of software development are quite limited,
so do not expect help, debugging efforts or other support.

## License
Almost all parts of Qudi are licensed under GPLv3 (see LICENSE.txt) with the exception of some files that originate from the Jupyter/IPython project.
