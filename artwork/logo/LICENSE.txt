Usage Policy (Trademarks and Project Identity)

	The Qudi Logo represents graphically the identiy of the Qudi project and
	software suite.  As such, its use is regulated by trademark law (as well
	as copyright law).  The CC-BY-NC-SA license addresses copyright
	regulations, but the following guidelines protect the Qudi project
	identity.

	The core idea is that you are not allowed to use the Qudi logo in a way
	that would confuse the connection between this logo and the Qudi project.

	You may not
	- distribute Qudi code using a modified version of the logo;
	- use the logo in a way that suggests any type of association or partnership
	  with the Qudi project, sponsorship or endorsement by the Qudi developers 
	  (unless allowed via a license from us)
