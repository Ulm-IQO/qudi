Clarification:

  The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
  software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to
  be valid for this artwork library too.

  Qudi Theme Icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
  artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
  GUI.

  Source code, for this library means:
   - where they exist, SVG;
   - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
  otherwise png.

  The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
  notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.

  With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
  containing the elements. You may follow this practice.

  The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
  the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
